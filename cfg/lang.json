This allows you to interface with EuphoriaBot in order to automatically send your messages under several different names. The group of names you can send messages under is known as your **system**, and an individual name is known as a **member**. The first argument of !plural is the *subcommand* you want to use: each has its own special syntax, outlined below.```!plural add <name>```This command adds a member to your system with default specifications.```!plural delete <name>```This command removes a member from your system.```!plural edit <name> <name|avatar|prefix|postfix> <value>```This command lets you change the various attributes of a member of your system. **name** is the display name of the member, **avatar** is a URL to an image the member uses as its profile picture (you can leave blank for the default Discord profile picture), **prefix** is the string placed *before* a message to indicate the member, and **postfix** is the string placed *after* a message to inficate the member. It is recommended that the value (and the name, if longer than one word) is placed in quotes, like so:```!plural edit LynneA name 'Lynne's First'``````!plural list```This is the simplest command -- it provides a card that lists the current members of your system, their message formats, and the links to their profile pictures.\""
